# whereIsDarwin

This is a project to know where is my cat (Darwin) from differents spots on the house using a chatterbot from Facebook Messenger.

I will use a lot of expertises to do that: Machine Learning to classify my cat; AIML scripts to have a nice conversation; HTTPs Rest API to integrate with Facebook Messenger and improve my English and writing Skills!

I really want you enjoy it! :)
